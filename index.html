          <h3><b>1) Hotel Website - Seven Seasons Hotels & Resorts</b></h3>
            <p><i>I applied my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to envision and construct a vibrant hotel website. Through the seamless integration of these technologies, I artfully crafted an interactive user interface that elegantly presents the hotel's offerings, services, and booking options.

          <h3><b>2) Robotic Movement using Hand Gestures</b></h3>
          <p><i>This project was constructed using ML and Automation techniques. We
used the hand gesture algoritms to simulate a robot to perform motion
tasks, like moving in a straight line, curves, and symmetric planes. The
robot had the capability to detect obstructions in the course through
sensors and webcam, and alert the user. One major point of application
could be in making crossings, digital inscriptions and markings on road and
pavements.</i></p>
